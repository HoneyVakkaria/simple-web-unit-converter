Hello everyone, the idea of this project was taken from [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter)

## How it works
First of all, clone this repository and then go to /backend directory of the project and run main.go file

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HoneyVakkaria/simple-web-unit-converter.git
cd simple-web-unit-converter/backend
go run main.go
```

Second of all, go to [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/)
